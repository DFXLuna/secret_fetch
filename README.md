# secrets
- Install [elixir & mix](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
  - On Ubuntu, use the rabbitmq repos as shown in the ubuntu section
- Create or gather an infisical client_id and client_secret under access control > identities
- Load up environment variables / .env+readenv with
  - `CLIENT_ID`
  - `CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `WORKSPACE_ID`
  - `WORKSPACE_ENV`
- Build with `mix escript.build`
- Run `./secrets pull INFISICAL_PATH`
  - It will go secret by secret in `INFISICAL_PATH` and pull the contents of each secret into an `.env` into a folder if a secret with the same name exists in infisical.
  - It does NOT run recursively
  - You probably want `./secrets pull /` to pull from the root of your infisical project
